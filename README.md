# Challenge-2-UofT


Welcome to my first website, which I create from scratch! Here are some important details and instructions to help you navigate the website:

## Description
This website was created as a project for the UofT Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I am building a portfolio that can showcase my skills and talents.  

I applied some CSS skills that I recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

Also, this website was created to run on a desktop and mobile environment. 

So, I added <alt> attributes in every image and <title> in the background image, adjusted contrast and changed the typography to meet the accessibility standards. 

## Getting started
To access the website, simply type in the website address in your browser. Once the website loads, you will be presented with the homepage. From there, you can navigate to different website sections using the menu bar at the top of the page.

A file .gif is available inside the assets folder.
