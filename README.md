# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my first website, which I created from scratch! This website was created as a project for the UofT Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I built a portfolio that showcases my skills and talents.

# Description
My portfolio website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I applied some CSS skills that I recently learned, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The website was designed to run on both desktop and mobile environments. I also made sure to meet accessibility standards by adding alt attributes to every image, adjusting contrast, and changing typography.

Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges I faced while creating this project was designing the website to be accessible for all users. I had to research and implement various techniques to ensure that the website met accessibility standards.
